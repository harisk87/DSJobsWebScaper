# DSJobsWebScaper
This project is my first web scraper for locations and companies hiring data scientists. I scrape Indeed.com search results for the job "Data Scientist" and visualize where the jobs are and who the major hirers are.

This project is an extension of ideas introduced in Lecture 2 of Harvard's CS109 course from Fall 2015, and also of a project by Jesse Steinweg-Woods (https://jessesw.com/Data-Science-Skills/)
